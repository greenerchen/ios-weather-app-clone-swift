# ios-weather-app-clone-swift
Implemented an iOS weather app clone with Swift, OpenWeatherMap API, MVVM and Coordinator design patterns, and RxSwift

I've learned about how to use MVVM and Coordinator design patterns, RxSwift, Scrollviews, support dark mode and iOS 14's new UIPageControl from this side project. Some notes are here. I used ReactiveCocoa before. When I was learning RxSwift, I realized that RxSwift is now popular and RxSwift community is strong which makes more RxSwift code neat, especially using RxDataSources.
